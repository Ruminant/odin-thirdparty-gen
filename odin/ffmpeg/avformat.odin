/**
* This structure describes decoded (raw) audio or video data.
*
* AVFrame must be allocated using av_frame_alloc(). Note that this only
* allocates the AVFrame itself, the buffers for the data must be managed
* through other means (see below).
* AVFrame must be freed with av_frame_free().
*
* AVFrame is typically allocated once and then reused multiple times to hold
* different data (e.g. a single AVFrame to hold frames received from a
* decoder). In such a case, av_frame_unref() will free any references held by
* the frame and reset it to its original clean state before it
* is reused again.
*
* The data described by an AVFrame is usually reference counted through the
* AVBuffer API. The underlying buffer references are stored in AVFrame.buf /
* AVFrame.extended_buf. An AVFrame is considered to be reference counted if at
* least one reference is set, i.e. if AVFrame.buf[0] != NULL. In such a case,
* every single data plane must be contained in one of the buffers in
* AVFrame.buf or AVFrame.extended_buf.
* There may be a single buffer for all the data, or one separate buffer for
* each plane, or anything in between.
*
* sizeof(AVFrame) is not a part of the public ABI, so new fields may be added
* to the end with a minor bump.
*
* Fields can be accessed through AVOptions, the name string used, matches the
* C structure field name for fields accessible through AVOptions.

	/**
	* @defgroup metadata_api Public Metadata API
	* @{
	* @ingroup libavf
	* The metadata API allows libavformat to export metadata tags to a client
	* application when demuxing. Conversely it allows a client application to
	* set metadata when muxing.
	*
	* Metadata is exported or set as pairs of key/value strings in the 'metadata'
	* fields of the AVFormatContext, AVStream, AVChapter and AVProgram structs
	* using the @ref lavu_dict "AVDictionary" API. Like all strings in FFmpeg,
	* metadata is assumed to be UTF-8 encoded Unicode. Note that metadata
	* exported by demuxers isn't checked to be valid UTF-8 in most cases.
	*
	* Important concepts to keep in mind:
	* -  Keys are unique; there can never be 2 tags with the same key. This is
	*    also meant semantically, i.e., a demuxer should not knowingly produce
	*    several keys that are literally different but semantically identical.
	*    E.g., key=Author5, key=Author6. In this example, all authors must be
	*    placed in the same tag.
	* -  Metadata is flat, not hierarchical; there are no subtags. If you
	*    want to store, e.g., the email address of the child of producer Alice
	*    and actor Bob, that could have key=alice_and_bobs_childs_email_address.
	* -  Several modifiers can be applied to the tag name. This is done by
	*    appending a dash character ('-') and the modifier name in the order
	*    they appear in the list below -- e.g. foo-eng-sort, not foo-sort-eng.
	*    -  language -- a tag whose value is localized for a particular language
	*       is appended with the ISO 639-2/B 3-letter language code.
	*       For example: Author-ger=Michael, Author-eng=Mike
	*       The original/default language is in the unqualified "Author" tag.
	*       A demuxer should set a default if it sets any translated tag.
	*    -  sorting  -- a modified version of a tag that should be used for
	*       sorting will have '-sort' appended. E.g. artist="The Beatles",
	*       artist-sort="Beatles, The".
	* - Some protocols and demuxers support metadata updates. After a successful
	*   call to av_read_frame(), AVFormatContext.event_flags or AVStream.event_flags
	*   will be updated to indicate if metadata changed. In order to detect metadata
	*   changes on a stream, you need to loop through all streams in the AVFormatContext
	*   and check their individual event_flags.
	*
	* -  Demuxers attempt to export metadata in a generic format, however tags
	*    with no generic equivalents are left as they are stored in the container.
	*    Follows a list of generic tag names:
	*
	@verbatim
	album        -- name of the set this work belongs to
	album_artist -- main creator of the set/album, if different from artist.
	e.g. "Various Artists" for compilation albums.
	artist       -- main creator of the work
	comment      -- any additional description of the file.
	composer     -- who composed the work, if different from artist.
	copyright    -- name of copyright holder.
	creation_time-- date when the file was created, preferably in ISO 8601.
	date         -- date when the work was created, preferably in ISO 8601.
	disc         -- number of a subset, e.g. disc in a multi-disc collection.
	encoder      -- name/settings of the software/hardware that produced the file.
	encoded_by   -- person/group who created the file.
	filename     -- original name of the file.
	genre        -- <self-evident>.
	language     -- main language in which the work is performed, preferably
	in ISO 639-2 format. Multiple languages can be specified by
	separating them with commas.
	performer    -- artist who performed the work, if different from artist.
	E.g for "Also sprach Zarathustra", artist would be "Richard
	Strauss" and performer "London Philharmonic Orchestra".
	publisher    -- name of the label/publisher.
	service_name     -- name of the service in broadcasting (channel name).
	service_provider -- name of the service provider in broadcasting.
	title        -- name of the work.
	track        -- number of this work in the set, can be in form current/total.
	variant_bitrate -- the total bitrate of the bitrate variant that the current stream is part of
